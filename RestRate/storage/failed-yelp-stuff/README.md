Group 1's API Project
Our plan is to use the Yelp and Twilio APIs to create an app that allows the user to text the name of a restaurant they are contemplating dining at to a number and recieve a 160 character summary of what they need to know. This would include Yelp's numerical rating, parts of reviews, and potentially more. The goal is to enable someone without a smartphone to get vital information on an eatery before they walk in.
