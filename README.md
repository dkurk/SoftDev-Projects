SoftDev-Projects
================

Here are a few projects I did as a senior in Mr. Zamansky's software development class at Stuyvesant HS! It's the first time I'm delving into a lot of things, but I hope you all enjoy!

I will add more here as the year is ending. Also, some of the projects haven't been deployed for a bit (like the Restaurant Rate app), however feel free to look at the code. I will try to redeploy these soon so that they can be seen in their full glory!
